I created this project to learn the high level functionings of react javascript framework.

Project: 
- Creating Robofriends application that searches through a list of given users in realtime based on keywords.
- It involves creating reusable components for creating a grid element as a combination of image, name and description of a particular robot.
- Using state and props to propel values between components.

Disclaimer:  please note that this project is done for self learning purposes only and is not meant to be sold/distributed/used for any kind of moonitory gains or infringements.
